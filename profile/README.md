# Options Interstate Resource Center for Independent Living

Options is a non-profit organization committed to assisting individuals with disabilities to live independently in the communities of their choice and to eliminate attitudinal, architectural and communication barriers from the environment.

## Our Vision

Options sees a world where people with disabilities: enjoy the same human and civil rights as citizens without disabilities; live, attend school, work and play in an integrated accessible community; are respected citizens and community leaders; and face no attitudinal, architectural or communication barriers.
